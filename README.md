# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Karol!
### Software Architect & Full-Stack Developer
Iâ€™m a passionate software creator specializing in designing and building complex, efficient, and scalable systems. My work focuses on bridging high-level architectural vision with low-level implementation to deliver solutions that are not only technically elegant but also pragmatic and effective.
- ðŸ”­ Currently exploring the performance frontiers in **Rust** and **GraalVM Native Image**.
- ðŸŒ± Honing my skills in **declarative system management** using **NixOS**.
- ðŸ’¬ Happy to discuss **software architecture, compiler theory, distributed systems, and AI modeling**.

---
## ðŸš€ About Me
As a developer, I navigate between different paradigms and ecosystemsâ€”from low-level system programming in **Rust** and **C**, to building robust enterprise applications in **Java (Spring Boot)**, to crafting dynamic interfaces in **TypeScript/React**.
Iâ€™m fascinated by performance optimization, automation, and creating reproducible development environments, reflected in my projects using **GraalVM**, **Docker**, and **NixOS**. I believe the best software emerges at the intersection of deep computer science fundamentals and a practical approach to solving real-world problems.

## ðŸ“‚ My Projects
Below is a detailed overview of my most important work. Projects are grouped thematically to showcase the breadth of my skills.

### I. System Architecture & Conceptual Projects
*In this section, I present deep technical explorations that go beyond standard implementation. These are case studies and architectural specifications demonstrating the ability to design complex systems from scratch.*

<details>
<summary><strong>Project Nexus: Specification for a Unified Programming Language</strong></summary>
> **Project Goal:** Design and specify a new programming language (`.nx`) and its ecosystem. The aim is to create a successor that synthesizes the performance of C, the productivity of Python, and the asynchronicity of JavaScript into a single coherent paradigm.
>
> **Key Architectural Concepts:**
> - **Unified Intermediate Representation (UIR):** The core systemâ€”a common intermediate representation into which code from various languages is compiled, enabling unprecedented optimizations.
> - **Library Ingestor (`nexlink`):** A tool for transpiling existing libraries (C, Python, JS) into the native `.nexlib` format, eliminating the need for FFI (Foreign Function Interface).
> - **Polyglot Optimizer:** An advanced optimizer capable of cross-language transformations, such as inlining a Python function directly into a Nexus loop.
> - **Dual Memory Model:** Default safe memory management (ARC + GC) with the ability to switch to a `perf {}` block with manual allocation and borrow-checking inspired by Rust.
>
> **Project Value:** Demonstrates deep understanding of **compiler theory, language design, operating systems, and complex software architecture**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Project Phoenix: Hybrid Desktop Application Architecture</strong></summary>
> **Project Goal:** Design a hybrid desktop application architecture that combines **instant startup and low memory usage** (characteristic of native apps) with **the speed and flexibility of web UI development**.
>
> **Key Architectural Concepts:**
> - **Native Backend (AOT Compilation):** Backend in **Spring Boot** compiled to a native binary using **GraalVM Native Image**, ensuring startup in a fraction of a second.
> - **Java Frontend:** User interface written in Java, then compiled to high-performance JavaScript/WebAssembly using tools like `J2CL`.
> - **Desktop Shell:** Minimalist **JavaFX** application with a `WebView` component that renders the web frontend, running on a standard JVM.
> - **Strict API Contract:** Shared Maven module with DTOs, ensuring type safety and serving as a formal contract between client and server.
>
> **Project Value:** Shows the ability to design **complex, multi-module systems**, knowledge of advanced compilation techniques, and making informed architectural trade-offs.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Architectural Case Studies (Startups as Technical Ideas)</strong></summary>
> These projects are technical analyses of business problems, presented as ready-made architectural concepts for hypothetical startups.
>
> 1. **Intellexa - Market Intelligence from AI Conversations:**
>    - **Problem:** Companies have millions of AI chatbot logs ("dark data") that are an untapped resource.
>    - **Technical Solution:** Three-tier SaaS platform (B2B). **Tier 1 (Ignite):** Analytical dashboard with PII anonymization and topic clustering. **Tier 2 (Accelerate):** Adds API for insights and benchmarking. **Tier 3 (Apex):** Introduces Fine-Tuning as a Service (FaaS) and dedicated data strategist support. Architecture based on microservices, stream processing, and NLP models.
>
> 2. **Integrit Labs - Integration as a Service:**
>    - **Problem:** Engineers waste valuable time integrating and maintaining external SDKs (Stripe, Twilio, Scandit), instead of focusing on product development.
>    - **Technical Solution:** Integration services company evolving into a platform. **Phase 1:** Expert services (fixed-price). **Phase 2:** Premium WordPress plugin (`Integrit Connect`). **Phase 3:** Creation of `Integrit API`â€”a unified "API to API" that becomes the main SaaS product.
>
> 3. **LearnSphere Academy - EdTech Platform:**
>    - **Problem:** Need for a professional, engaging educational platform.
>    - **Technical Solution:** Landing page design and initial system architecture. Frontend in **Next.js** (for SEO and performance), backend as a **Headless CMS** (e.g., Strapi) for content management (courses, tutors) and API for handling registrations and consultations. Future integration with **SphereLabs AI**â€”a custom LLM module for personalized learning.
>
> **Project Value:** Demonstrates the ability to **translate business needs into concrete technical solutions** and think about scalability and monetization.
